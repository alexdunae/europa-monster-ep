<h2>Hey fam!</h2>

<p>You must be pretty special to me. You've got one of only 50 copies of my album. Here are digital links to play all the songs and a few little videos I made.</p>

<p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/19VmAlY2I5fuSuzqYUTUTs?si=ppg-ku-cS4mIDmCi9-2r-A">&gt;&gt; Listen on Spotify</a></p>

<h2>What's it for?</h2>

<p>All my life I've bounced back and forth between music and technology. Sometimes I'd deep dive into music for half a year, then rediscover technology and walk around with code in my head for another few months.</p>

<ul>
<li>Both have loops</li>
<li>Both have keyboards</li>
<li>Both are the enemy of going to bed early</li>
</ul>

<p>In 2020 I finally clued in that tech and music go together really well. Duh.</p>

<p>Making these tracks was my COVID mental health outlet. As my livelihood became pretty uncertain, making beats was an amazing and fun escape.</p>

<h2>Why Europa Monster?</h2>

<p>It's my favourite animal. When my I need an animal to draw with my kids, I always choose a Europa monster. It lives in the water under the ice that covers Jupiter's icy moon: Europa.</p>
